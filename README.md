# Boids Algorithm Implementation

## Background
So, last night, I got fascinated by this algorithm called "Boids Algorithm." It is a (seemingly) simple algorithm containing three easy-to-understand rules for the motion of objects in a closed space. When ran successfully, this motion of objects very closely replicates the flocking nature of birds in flight!

I also think that the name "boid" must be a fancy way of writing "bird." However, after going through the paper, I realised that it stands for "bird-oid." Equally fun, I guess?
